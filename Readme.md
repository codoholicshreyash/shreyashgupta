### ðŸ§© Instructions:
1. Replace:
   - `shreyashgupta-dev` with your actual GitHub username
   - `your-image-link.com` with real image URLs (host on GitHub, Imgur, etc.)
   - LinkedIn/Instagram handles
2. Push this in the repo named **exactly the same as your GitHub username**
3. Enable GitHub profile README from GitHub â†’ Profile â†’ Edit

Would you like me to:
- Create an actual folder with this and `images/` placeholders?
- Include animations or Lottie files too?
- Add sections for blogs or certifications?

Let me know and I can prepare a full ZIP or GitHub-ready repo.
